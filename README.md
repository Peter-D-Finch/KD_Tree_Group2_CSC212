# KD_Tree_Group2_CSC212

To run the image recognition program download the K-D_Tree_Image_Recognition folder and upload it to cs50 IDE. Then navigate to the directory containing main.cpp and use 'g++ main.cpp -o prog && ./prog" to run it. It will then ask you for a filepath of the image you wish to use. Looking inside the dataset directory there are four directories each with the name of the person who's photos it contains. Inside each of those directories is a pngs folder that contains a test image in the format 'Name_Test.png' that can be used to test the program. These .pngs are pre-binarized and the only unbinarized test image currently is dataset/Alec/pngs/Alec_Test2.png.

To run the flower recognition program is very similiar to the above. Download K-D_Tree_Image_Recognition then compile and run main.cpp. This time the user will be asked to enter measurements for the flower, and for testing purposes you can look at the text file in Flower_Classification to get an idea of what the measurements should look like for different species.
